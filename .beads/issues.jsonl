Player must deal with them before they reach the center. Ties into Arya Pet health/memory stats as a gamified view. Could use real data from health-checkups.json, SRS items, and other tracked obligations. Visual: concentric rings with problems moving inward, towers/defenses represent good habits.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"tmad4000@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-18T10:56:11.878284-07:00","created_by":"Jacob Cole","updated_at":"2026-02-18T10:56:20.556679-07:00"}
